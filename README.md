Flash/Flex-based 2d Avatar Chat Client

How to Build
------------

Needs Flashbuilder (trial) to build.
Clone the Repository, then choose "Import Flash Builder Project" and open the folders AS3Iptscrae, FlashPalace and PalaceClient.

You might need to switch to Flex 4.5 explicitly in Project/Properties/Flex Library Compiler. Then compile it and use whats generated in the FlashPalace/bin-debug folder.
